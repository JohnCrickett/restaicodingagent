    "- Maintenance – Keeping existing systems running\n",
    "- Refactoring – Restructuring without changing behaviour\n",
    "- Performance Optimisation – Improving speed, memory usage, or efficiency\n",
    "- Rewriting – Replacing old code with new\n",
    "- Porting – Moving code to new platforms/languages\n",
    "- Debugging – Tracing issues through existing code\n",
    "- Bug Fixing – Diagnosing and solving defects \n",
    "- Testing – Writing unit tests, integration tests, or fixing test suites\n",
    "- Code Review – Evaluating others' code for quality, bugs, and standards\n",
    "- Documentation – Writing/updating technical docs, comments, READMEs\n",
    "- Infrastructure – Managing deployment and infrastructure as code\n",
    "- Legacy Code Comprehension – Understanding unfamiliar or old codebases\n",
    "\n",
    "My experience suggests AI tools perform very differently across these categories. Greenfield and documentation are strengths. Refactoring, code-review and debugging in complex systems? Less so. But I want to test that against your experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you think?\n",
